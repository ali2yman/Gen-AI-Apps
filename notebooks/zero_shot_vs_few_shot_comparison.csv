Determine if this statement is a fact or opinion: 'Coffee is the best beverage for morning productivity.',"assistant

This statement is an opinion. The reason is that ""best"" is a subjective term, and people may have different preferences when it comes to their morning beverage. While some people may agree that coffee is the best beverage for morning productivity, others may prefer tea, juice, or other options.
